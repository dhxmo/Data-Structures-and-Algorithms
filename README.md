This is a collection of some pre-requisite data structures and algorithm problems to go further into competitive programming

I've broken up the whole thing into : <br />
01 - Array <br />
02- Matrix <br />
03 - String <br />
04 - Searching and Sorting <br />
05 - Linked List <br />
06 - Binary Trees <br />
07 - Binary Search Trees <br />
08 - Greedy <br />
09 - Backtracking <br />
10 - Stacks and Queues <br />
11 - Heap <br />
12 - Graph <br />
13 - Trie <br />
14 - Dynamic Programming <br />
15 - Bit Manipulation <br />

Go check out his youtube channel as well, some good stuff there.
